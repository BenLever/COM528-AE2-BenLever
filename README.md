This e-commerce web application was built with Java using Spring MVC and Spring Boot. To handle the data used in the app, I am using Hibernate.

```
mvn clean install
```
Then move to the web project within Netbeans and right click the web project and click "Build With Dependencies"
After doing so, right click again on the web project and click "Run"
